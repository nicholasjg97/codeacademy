// Create the variable vacationSpots, and assign its value to an array of three strings naming places you’d like to visit.
// Next, console.log() each item in vacationSpots. Since we don’t know loops yet, we have to console.log() each element in the array separately.

// Write your code below
var vacationSpots = ['Houston', 'New York', 'Miami;']
console.log(vacationSpots[0]);
console.log(vacationSpots[1]);
console.log(vacationSpots[2]);


// Create a program that loops from 5 to 10 and logs each number to the console.

for (let counter = 5; counter < 11; counter++) {
    console.log(counter);
  }


  Make a for loop that loops backwards printing 3 to 0 to the console. Use the >= comparison operator in your stopping condition and the -- operator in your iteration statement.

  for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--) {
    console.log(counter)
  }
